                <p><b>Mohan Das Karamchandra Gandhi</b> was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political
                    ethicist who employed nonviolent
                    resistance to lead the
                    successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil
                    rights and freedom
                    across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to
                    him in South Africa
                    in 1914, is now used throughout the world. Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat,
                    Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple in London, and was
                    called to the bar in June 1891, at the age of 22. </p>
                <p> After two uncertain years in India, where he was
                    unable to start a
                    successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a
                    lawsuit. He went on to
                    live in South Africa for 21 years. There, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent
                    resistance in a campaign
                    for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants,
                    farmers, and urban
                    labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land-tax.</p>
